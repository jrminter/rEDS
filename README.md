rEDS
=================================================================
Process X-Ray EDS data with R using S4 classes

This is a work in progress. It is an attempt to wrap some
pre-release code from Jeff Davis at NIST and some of my own
(J. Minter) into a r-package documented by roxygen2. The goal
is to get a useful package that passes R CMD CHECK without
errors.

This is a prototype, not ready for prime time.
